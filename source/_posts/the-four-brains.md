title: The Four Brains
---

During my mind-body exploration I've come to realise 4 areas of the whole-body-mind (see here) that represent core decision-making "brains". The word "brain" here is used to describe a decision making system. 

**The Four Decision Making Systems (aka Brains)**

*The Left Brain*

*The Right Brain*

*The Intestine*

*The Heart*

This is the most inteligent of them all. Its expression is emotional, yet its incredibly logic and supernatural uniting the best of all the other 3 and therefore delivering the best decisions. In my experience the heart delivers decisions based on DESIRE, and therefore its decision's criteria is the ressonance with what I desire or not. From a neutral observer point of view (as describe in Power of Now), one can ask "Heart, is this what I want?" or "Heart, this or that?". While listening to the answers, the emotional response will express how much ressonance each possibilty has. According to Abraham Hicks works, the levels of resonance can be measured by the Emotional Guidance Scale:

In order for one to develop fluency in heart decision making, I'd recommend the meditating with the following intentions:

*Establishing Neutral Observer Point of View* 

**Neutrality:** 
Free your mind from every judgement. There's no good or bad, right or wrong. Everything can be transformed from a new point a view. 

**Observancy:**
Rooting my mind in my body. Staying present, in the now and adopting neutrality, understanding that each and each and every thought passes through me and out of me and therefore I am not thinking, rather, I am observing the thoughts, like seagulls flying in the sky, each going in a self-created direction, which I can choose which to focus on. Quanticly, as the owner of the sky, my view changes their direction, so with a view of neutrality, I allow or not their natural path to show themselves. 


That is for me the combination that reveals the true current paths of your mind, from which I can not only know your self but be able to see the *Natural Beauty* in the mind (The Natural Beauty).
